# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is the first step toward building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. The goal of this project is to create a command interpreter that will be used to manage AirBnB objects. The command interpreter will be developed incrementally and will serve as the basis for future projects involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Project Description

The AirBnB clone project aims to create a simplified version of the AirBnB web application. The project will be developed in several stages, each adding more features and functionalities. The first stage involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

The command interpreter will allow users to:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, Place)
- Retrieve objects from a file
- Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
- Update object attributes
- Destroy objects

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is similar to a shell but limited to managing AirBnB objects. It provides the following functionality:

- Create new objects
- Retrieve objects
- Perform operations on objects
- Update object attributes
- Destroy objects

### Features

- **Interactive Mode**: Start the interpreter and execute commands.
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Execute commands from a file or pipeline.
